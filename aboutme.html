      <h1>Why Programming?</h1>
      <p>I have a curiosity to understand how things work. When I first saw code and what it could do, I was fascinated
        but it was presented in a very complex way. I was curious but I did not know where to start. I then
        discovered Moringa School and decided to enroll and learn. </p>
